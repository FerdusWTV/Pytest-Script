# Change the env

set the env for Development: --env=dev
set the env for Production: --env=prod
```
pytest -v --env=dev  --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```


## This is a ChatGPT conversation for how to use it with jenkins and stop the build.
=================================================================================
```
now, i want to stop the build when a test is failed and want to know where that error occured exactly.
```

```
Excellent — you’re thinking exactly like a CI/CD engineer now 👏

Let’s make your **pytest + Jenkins** setup automatically:
✅ **Stop the build if any test fails**, and
✅ **Show exactly where the failure happened** (test name, file, line, and error message).

---

## 🧩 Step 1 — Understand how pytest signals failure

Pytest already exits with a **non-zero exit code** when a test fails.
That’s what Jenkins (or any CI) looks at to decide whether the build passes or fails.

So in your pipeline or terminal, you don’t need extra code — just let pytest fail normally:

```bash
pytest -v --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```

If **any test fails**, pytest will return **exit code 1**,
and Jenkins will mark the build as **FAILED** and stop the pipeline.

---

## 🧩 Step 2 — (Optional but recommended) Limit to first failure

If you want the build to **stop immediately** on the first test failure, add:

```bash
--maxfail=1
```

So full command:

```bash
pytest -v --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```

✅ That makes the run faster and fails fast.

---

## 🧩 Step 3 — See exactly *where* the failure occurred

When pytest runs in your terminal, it shows a detailed traceback like:

```
__________________________ test_login_functionality ___________________________

driver = <selenium.webdriver.chrome.webdriver.WebDriver (session="abc123")>

    def test_login_functionality(driver):
        driver.get("https://example.com/login")
>       assert driver.title == "Dashboard"
E       AssertionError: assert 'Login Page' == 'Dashboard'
E         - Login Page
E         + Dashboard

tests/test_login.py:42: AssertionError
```

🔍 This tells you:

* The **file** (`tests/test_login.py`)
* The **line** (`42`)
* The **error message** (`AssertionError: ...`)

And in your **HTML report**, the same information appears in a collapsible section for each failed test.

---

## 🧩 Step 4 — Jenkins integration (to stop the build automatically)

In your `Jenkinsfile`, make sure your test stage looks like this:

```groovy
stage('Run Selenium Tests') {
    steps {
        sh '''
        source venv/bin/activate
        pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -v \
               --html=report.html --self-contained-html \
               --junitxml=report.xml
        '''
    }
    post {
        always {
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'report.html', fingerprint: true
            junit 'report.xml'
        }
        failure {
            echo "❌ Tests failed! Check report.html or Jenkins console for details."
        }
    }
}
```

✅ If any test fails:

* Jenkins immediately marks the build as **FAILED**
* The build stops
* The console output shows the **exact test and file** that failed
* You can open `report.html` in Jenkins to view full tracebacks

---

## 🧩 Step 5 — (Optional) Make errors easier to spot in console

You can add `-rA` to show a short summary at the end of the run:

```bash
pytest -v --maxfail=1 -rA --disable-warnings \
       --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```

This adds a clear section like:

```
==== short test summary info ====
FAILED tests/test_webcast_flow.py::test_06_configure_webcast_layout - AssertionError: expected Save button not found
```

---

### ✅ TL;DR Summary

| Goal                              | What to do                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stop build when test fails        | Nothing extra — pytest exit code = 1                             |
| Stop immediately on first failure | Add `--maxfail=1`                                                |
| Show failure details              | Add `-v -rA`                                                     |
| Save full HTML + XML reports      | `--html=report.html --self-contained-html --junitxml=report.xml` |
| Make Jenkins fail the build       | Jenkins auto-stops on pytest non-zero exit                       |

---

Would you like me to show you how to **colorize and shorten the Jenkins console logs** (so it shows only the test name and error line, not the full stack trace)? That makes CI output much cleaner.
